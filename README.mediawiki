This script will save an enigma2 configuration into a TV-Headend configuration.
You can use this script with the following syntax:

 ./e2ToTVH.py -i <enigma2 source directory> -o <tv-headend configuration directory>

You can show additional help by using the '''-h''' switch.

=== My last words ===
Have fun with this little goodie...
