Based on work by ''Sascha Schmidt''

Updated 30-12-2015

- now supports a channel being part of multiple bouquets
- supports vanilla enigma v4 lamedb
- tv/radio bouquet type determination based on bouquetfile extension (.tv/.radio)

This script will save an enigma2 configuration into a TV-Headend configuration.
You can use this script with the following syntax:

 ./e2ToTVH.py -i <enigma2 source directory> -o <tv-headend configuration directory>

You can show additional help by using the '''-h''' switch.

This script will '''not''' overwrite any existing configuration. You have to move the TV-Headend subdirectories:
 config/
 tag/
to a different (backup) location. The script will stop if an existing configuration is detected.

=== Notes ===
* Please make sure that you use a new enigma2 release which uses lamedb in version 4.
* This script will produce output which works fine with the latest git release of TV-Headend. The stable release is '''not''' supported.
