This script will save an enigma2 configuration into a TV-Headend configuration.
You can use this script with the following syntax:

 ./e2ToTVH.py -i <enigma2 source directory> -o <tv-headend configuration directory>

You can show additional help by using the '''-h''' switch.

This script will '''not''' overwrite any existing configuration. You have to move the TV-Headend subdirectories:
 channel/
 channeltags/
to a different (backup) location. The script will stop if an existing configuration is detected.

Since I'm developing in my free time I'd like to ask you to support my work.
You can do it by contributing 5 EUR via paypal. This will give me motivation
to keep on coding and fixing bugs.

Thanks in advance

=== Notes ===
* Please make sure that you use a new enigma2 release which uses lamedb in version 4.
* This script will produce output which works fine with the latest git release of TV-Headend. The stable release is '''not''' supported.

=== My last words ===
Have fun with this little goodie...
